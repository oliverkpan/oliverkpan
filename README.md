# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Oliver

![](https://github.com/oliverkpan/oliverkpan/blob/master/profile_vid.gif)

Thanks for checking out my [profile](https://github.com/oliverkpan)! I am currently a 3rd year student at the University of Toronto, studying business and computer science. 

Currently, I am working at [Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan](https://www.otpp.com/) as a Data Management Intern. This work involves some ETL and SQL work, which I would love to talk about if you are interested! During the Summer 2020 semester, I worked as a Data Science Intern at [Royal Canin](https://www.royalcanin.com/ca/en_ca). In that role, I utilized Python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn) on a daily basis, as well various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and XGBoost. Previously during the Fall 2019 semester, I worked as a Data Analyst Intern at [Cardswap](www.cardswap.ca). I look forward to the positive experiences and learning opportunities in my current and future roles.

From my past internships, I have been able to utilize my analytical and technical skills to find success. I have a strong understanding of Python programming, specifically paired with Jupyter Notebook. I have a passion for learning and programming, and would love to meet up for a coffee chat.

Yours Sincerely,

**Oliver Pan**
