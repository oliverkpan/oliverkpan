### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Oliver

![](https://github.com/oliverkpan/oliverkpan/blob/master/profile_vid.gif)

Thanks for checking out my [profile](https://github.com/oliverkpan)! I am a business and computer science student by day, data enthusiast by night. 

Technically speaking, I have been able to utilize my analytical and technical skills to find success in my career. I have a strong understanding of Python programming, specifically paired with Jupyter Notebook. I have a passion for learning and programming, and would love to meet up for a coffee chat.

Currently, I am working as a Data Science Intern at [Royal Canin](https://www.royalcanin.com/ca/en_ca). I utilize Python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn) on a daily basis, as well various machine learning models. Previously, I have worked as a Data Analyst Intern at [Cardswap](www.cardswap.ca). During the Fall 2020 semester, I will be working at [Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan](https://www.otpp.com/) as a Data Management Intern. I look forward to the positive experiences and learning opportunities.

Please contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliverpan/) or visit my [website](oliverkpan.github.io) if you are looking for a results driven individual with a passion for data science and machine learning. 

Yours Sincerely,

**Oliver Pan**
